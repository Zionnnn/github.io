				<p>My name is Junyi Zhang. My student number is s3701407 and my student email is s3701407@student.rmit.edu.au. 
				   I was an overseas VCE student, so I can speak Chinese and English. Before coming to Australia, I played badminton pretty well.
				   After experiencing the culture of Australia, I started to get in touch with skateboarding,
				   because I often saw groups of skateboarders on the road, and the skateboarding culture slowly affected me.
				   I also raised a very cute lop-eared rabbit and it is one year old.</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>I like playing badminton</li>
					<li>I am a beginner skateboarder</li>
					<li>Music and funny videos are my source of happiness</li>

				<h2 class="major">Background</h2>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt=""></span>
				<p>My background is the bachelor of Information Technology
				   I completed the subject of my diploma in the first half of 2020.
				   When I was in high school, I was an overseas VCE student.</p>
				<p>
					Q1.What makes IT interesting for you?
				</p>
				<p>
					The IT industry covers a wide range. Generally speaking, it can be divided into manufacturing, software, hardware, network, and information systems.
					There will be more employment directions and choices in the near future. In the Internet environment, the IT industry is indispensable.
					The application created by IT technology means the birth of the information society. The richness and creativity of the IT industry has attracted me deeply. 
					I can develop software that I can think of or design a web page that I am satisfied with, and so on. At the same time, the salary level in the IT industry is also considerable.
					After possessing a certain ability, as an IT staff, you can often get a good salary to support yourself and prove your value to the society. Of course, the effort is proportional to the gain.
					Only after hard work can we live the life we want. My interest in IT started three years ago. I have a friend who understands IT much better than me, so I usually talk to him about this aspect. 
					My interest in IT is a cumulative process.
				</p>
				<p>
					Q2:What lead you to study at RMIT?
				</p>
					<p>
						When I was still studying in high school, I already knew RMIT. 
						As an overseas VCE student, I have a better understanding of RMIT's strong teachers and strengths in IT.
						I am also very satisfied with the annual world rankings. According to the 2018 QS2018 World University Rankings, RMIT has entered the top 100 in the global ranking of computer science and ranked 6th in Australia. 
						It also maintains the global ranking 100- 150. RMIT’s employment rate is also very high, which is inseparable from RMIT’s strong teaching and research capabilities.
				</p>
			
				<p>
					Q3.What do you expect to learn during your studies?
				</p>
				<p>
					After I graduated, I prefer to be an Android development engineer, using what I have learned to develop software or test platform functions.
					With the increasing number of Android users, the demand for its development team is in short supply. 
					So I want to learn more about java, besides it, html and CSS will make me more capable.

				<h2 class="major">Ideal Job</h2>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/1.png" alt=""></span>
				<p>https://www.seek.com.au/job/50385175?type=standout#searchRequestToken=76c94c1e-127b-458b-a622-e1613c8fb3de</p>
				<img src="images/2.png" alt="job">
				<p>
					First of all, working in this company can greatly improve my work ability. Secondly, the reason why this job attracts me is that the general salary of this job is 130k a year. This is also an important reason why I expect this job.

				</p>
					<p>
						This job requires knowledge of a certain Android or iOS system, and development of mobile applications, so basic JAVA and Android studio must also be used. Currently this company is still writing native applications, the direction is iBeacons, AR and RFID technologies, I have not learned about these aspects, I believe I can learn more in the near future.
					</p>
					<p>
						Currently I know some basic codes of HTML, CSS, and Java, and I am still in the preliminary learning stage. Will do some simple web pages and understand some basic knowledge about IT.
					</p>
					<p>
					I believe that I can learn most of the skills, experience and understanding that I need in my work during my undergraduate study at RMIT. Of course, I will also look at the experience and morals of experienced IT workers outside of class. I believe that there will be many doubts in my learning process along the way, but in this Internet age, IT can just help me understand better and make my own contribution to the IT industry.

				<h2 class="major">Project idea.</h2>
				<p>
				</p><p> Overview </p>

				<p>
					My project is talking about food delivery app in mobile phone. With the continuous progress of the Internet society, people's lives have become more and more convenient. One of them is that people can place orders with one click through the food delivery app on their mobile phones, and then they can wait for the courier to deliver them at home. This type of APP can quickly deliver fresh and satisfying food to the door with convenient daily necessities, and truly achieve convenient services without leaving the house.
				</p>
				<p> Motivation.</p>
				<p>
				Food delivery apps have a broad user base all over the world. Especially teenagers and office workers between 15 and 25 years old. Now most parts of the world are plagued by COVID-19, so contactless delivery and the ability to solve food problems without leaving the house have made food delivery apps more demanding. Of course, this kind of distribution APP platform can not only distribute food, but also daily necessities, epidemic prevention supplies, and various tools that may be used in life. When the business expands, the distribution platform APP can also enter the distribution grocery market. The business scope of distribution APP is quite wide, it can become an indispensable part of people's life.
				</p>
				<p> Description.</p>

				First of all, customers can browse the corresponding information of food materials or small products in life from the product information provided by merchants stationed on the platform. This information can provide users with a reference to measure the value of the product so that customers can judge whether they should buy the product.
				 The second point is that the platform can launch “recommended today”. Customers can get products recommended by merchants like customers through “recommend today”, and help customers make a choice so that the platform can obtain higher sales. 
				 The third point is recipe recommendation. When customers choose their favourite foods or tools, the platform's system will automatically recommend products that are similar or related to the purchased products to customers, helping customers purchase combinations or recipes that match the products. 
				 The fourth point is that the food delivery platform supports multiple payment methods. Customers can purchase goods through online payment or cash, but in Australia's current situation, platforms usually use online payment methods, such as credit card and we chat pay or Alipay. 
				 The fifth point is that customers can purchase ingredients or other products online through the Internet, so that they can shop without leaving home. 
				 The sixth point is that the food delivery app will support the global positioning system. Customers can not only check the delivery status of the delivery staff on the platform, but also correctly know the geographic location of the merchants. The platform can also quickly recommend nearby businesses to customers through the positioning system. 
				 The seventh point is that the food delivery APP will require merchants to provide online appointment services. Customers can choose when the merchant will deliver the goods to ensure the freshness of the delivered ingredients. 
				 The eighth point is that the initial interface of the platform will have a news section. If customers are interested in news content, they can quickly find product information and purchase. This can increase product usage.
				 The ninth point is that APP will have a lot of video teaching on the platform. If customers have this need, they can browse the video instruction provided by the merchant to get relevant knowledge on how to cook. 
				 The tenth point is that if the customer finds that the product does not match or is abnormal after receiving the product, he can choose to reject it and ask the platform or merchant to refund compensation.

				<p></p>
				<p>
				</p><p>Tools and Technologies.</p>
				UI design is one of the tools of the development platform. 
				UI design is the overall interface design work of the user interface designed by the designer based on the prototype, the functional icons and content filling of the app.
				The second is technology development. It is divided into front-end Android development, front-end IOS development, back-end development, and database development.
				The third step is app testing. Strict testing is required after app development, including functional testing and interface stress testing.

				<p></p>
				<p>
					Skills Required
				</p>
				<p>
					UI designers need to use Stetch and XD in mobile apps and need to meet the correctness of the four elements of the plane; 
					know how to use standard system Kits; can reasonably define fonts and element sizes; 
					be familiar with and be able to design mainstream component types. 
					Software development requires C++ or Java programming language and now the front-end has higher and higher requirements for algorithms, 
					especially Coding capabilities. The company can accurately understand the requirements and quickly implement high-quality code. 
					In addition, developers who master the basic knowledge of Web security, browser composition and principles, are proficient in using common front-end frameworks (React/Vue, etc.) 
					and have a certain understanding of their principles will be more excellent.
				</p>
				<p>
					Outcome
				</p>
				<p>
					If this project is successful, people’s eating habits will change and a new option will be added to get food.
					The development of takeaway apps has promoted social and economic development and also saved time for various groups of people in society.
					The emergence of this life phenomenon shows people's pursuit of life diversity. 
					The development of takeaway apps also provides employment opportunities for idle labor in society and drives the economic development of society.
					With the maturity of app software development technology, people have gradually become accustomed to using mobile app programs,
					which will also drive various industry apps for scheduled door-to-door services.

					According to the online learning style test, I’m a visual learner.
				</p>
				<p>
					The result is:
					As a visual learner, I can learn by reading or viewing pictures, and I can understand and remember things visually. 
					I can imagine what I have learned in my mind and learn best by using mainly visual methods.
			</p>
			<p>
					As a visual learner, I am usually clean and tidy. 
					I usually close my eyes to visualize or remember something, and if I feel bored, I will find something worth paying attention to.
					I may have difficulty with voice instructions and may be easily distracted by the sound. 
					I will be attracted by colors and spoken language (such as stories).
			</p>
			<p>
					What do the results of these tests mean for you?
			</P>
			<p>
					These tests analyzed my inner thoughts and how I am more suitable for work and gave me very good opinions.
			</p>
			<p>
					How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?
			</p>
			<p>
					My openness score is quite lower than the average score, it is 12.5% and the average score is 58%. 
					So I think working in real life can help me complete the team work in a down-to-earth manner. 
					I prefer to put my energy into real life. My conscientiousness score and extraversion score are all 42%. 
					It represents I will achieve victory in life in a way that does not attract attention. 
					At the same time, I will save more energy and concentrate on my work. So I prefer a quiet and simple life.
			</p>
			<p>
					How should you take this into account when forming a team?
			</p>
			<p>
					When forming a team, I prefer to be a contributor and follow the assigned tasks to complete with all my strength. 
					At the same time, I will also learn the way of leader management team.
